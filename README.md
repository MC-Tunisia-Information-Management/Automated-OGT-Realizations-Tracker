# Automated-OGT-Realizations-Tracker
The provided Google Apps Script is tailored for automating the extraction and manipulation of data related to OGT realizations from the AIESEC Global Information System (GIS) API using GraphQL queries. The script includes functions such as `dataExtraction` for fetching data via GraphQL queries, `dataManipulation` for formatting and inserting data into Google Sheets, and `main` to coordinate the execution of GraphQL queries for various application statuses (APDs, REs, Remote REs, FIs, and Breaks). It processes retrieved data to update or insert rows in a designated spreadsheet, facilitating streamlined tracking and reporting of OGT realizations. Additionally, utility functions handle error logging and update timestamps within the spreadsheet interface, ensuring automated and efficient management of real-time data updates.
